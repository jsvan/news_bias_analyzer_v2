# News Bias Analyzer - Architecture

## System Components

1. **Scraper Service**
   - Daily scrapers for major news outlets
   - Source categorization (region, political leaning)
   - Content extraction (headline, body, publication date)
   - HTML cleaning and text normalization

2. **Entity & Sentiment Analysis**
   - OpenAI API integration
   - Entity extraction (politicians, countries, parties, etc.)
   - Dual-dimension sentiment analysis (strength/weakness, good/evil)
   - Batch processing to manage API costs

3. **Database Layer**
   - Schema for articles, entities, sentiments
   - Time-series data structure
   - Query optimization for trend analysis
   - Backup and retention policies

4. **Analysis Engine**
   - Trend identification across time periods
   - Comparative analysis between sources
   - Anomaly detection for sudden narrative shifts
   - Statistical significance testing

5. **API Service**
   - RESTful endpoints for data access
   - Authentication and rate limiting
   - Query capabilities for frontend visualization

6. **Frontend/Extension**
   - Browser extension for real-time page analysis
   - Dashboard for trend visualization
   - Comparative tools for user content vs. global sentiment baseline

## Technical Stack

1. **Backend/Scraping**
   - Python with libraries like BeautifulSoup, Newspaper3k for scraping
   - Celery for task scheduling
   - FastAPI for API endpoints

2. **Database**
   - PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB extension for time-series data
   - Redis for caching frequently accessed data

3. **Infrastructure**
   - AWS (EC2 for computation, RDS for database, S3 for storage)
   - Docker for containerization
   - GitHub Actions for CI/CD

4. **Frontend**
   - JavaScript/TypeScript for browser extension
   - React for dashboard interface
   - D3.js for data visualization

## Data Flow

1. Scrapers run daily to collect articles from news sources
2. Text is cleaned and sent to OpenAI API for entity and sentiment extraction
3. Results are stored in database with metadata
4. Analysis engine processes data to identify trends and anomalies
5. API serves processed data to frontend components
6. Browser extension compares page content to database sentiment baselines

## Scaling Considerations

- Implement rate limiting and request batching for OpenAI API
- Set up incremental scraping to handle large news sources
- Implement caching at multiple levels to reduce load
- Consider serverless options for cost-optimization
