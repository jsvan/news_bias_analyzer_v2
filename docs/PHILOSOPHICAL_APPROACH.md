# Philosophical Approach to News Analysis

This document outlines the philosophical underpinnings of the News Bias Analyzer, inspired by Peter Pomerantsev's work on information manipulation, particularly his book "This Is Not Propaganda."

## Core Principles

### 1. Implicit Moral Compasses in News Media

All news sources operate from an implicit moral compass and vision for society's future. This is not a criticism but an observation of how media necessarily works:

- Some entities and events are framed as progress (moving society in the right direction)
- Others are portrayed as regression (taking society in the wrong direction)
- This framing happens through subtle word choices and emphasis, not overt statements

### 2. Entities as Moral Orientation Points

News articles use entities (people, organizations, countries, concepts) as orientation points to guide readers toward forming specific judgments:

- Entities are positioned as either supporting or opposing an implicit desired societal direction
- Individual actors are framed as representatives of larger cultural/ideological forces
- The mere selection of which entities to highlight reveals the news source's priorities

### 3. Strategic Temporal Inconsistency

Rather than maintaining consistent positions on entities over time, news sources shift their positioning strategically:

- The same entity may transform from positive to negative portrayal when strategic objectives change
- These shifts often happen without acknowledgment of the changed position
- By tracking these shifts over time, we can identify changing strategic narratives

### 4. Power-Moral Narrative Quadrants

When combining power and moral dimensions, four primary narrative archetypes emerge:

- **HERO** (high power, positive moral alignment): Powerful entities pushing society in the "right" direction
- **VILLAIN** (high power, negative moral alignment): Powerful entities pushing society in the "wrong" direction
- **VICTIM** (low power, positive moral alignment): Weak entities that deserve protection/support
- **THREAT** (low power, negative moral alignment): Weak entities that could become dangerous if not contained

## Analytical Framework

Our analytical framework operationalizes these principles through:

1. **Entity Extraction**: Identifying the key moral anchors in each article
2. **Two-Dimensional Analysis**:
   - Power dimension: How powerful vs. weak the entity is portrayed
   - Moral dimension: How the entity is positioned relative to the implicit societal vision
3. **Key Phrase Extraction**: Capturing the specific language that reveals positioning
4. **Temporal Tracking**: Monitoring how entity positioning shifts over time
5. **Statistical Comparison**: Identifying patterns across sources, countries, and time periods

## Practical Implications

This approach allows us to:

1. **Map Cultural Divides**: Identify how different news sources have different visions of societal progress
2. **Detect Strategic Shifts**: Track when and how narratives change around specific entities
3. **Compare Information Environments**: See how the same events are positioned differently in different media ecosystems
4. **Reveal Implicit Biases**: Surface the unspoken assumptions that drive news coverage

## Implementation

The implementation uses:

- **Advanced AI Analysis**: Using gpt-4.1-nano to detect subtle positioning in text
- **Careful Prompt Design**: Guiding the AI to focus on implicit moral positioning rather than traditional sentiment
- **Multi-Dimensional Visualization**: Using power/moral quadrant charts to visualize positioning
- **Temporal Comparison Tools**: Tracking entity positioning shifts over time
- **Statistical Analysis**: Comparing patterns across sources, countries, and time periods

## Methodological Notes

This approach:

- Makes no judgment about which news sources are "right" or "wrong"
- Does not claim to identify "fake news" or explicit misinformation
- Recognizes that all news sources necessarily have implicit values and visions
- Focuses on making these implicit frameworks visible for analysis

By understanding these implicit frameworks, we gain insight into how different information environments construct and contest reality, helping us navigate an increasingly complex media landscape.
