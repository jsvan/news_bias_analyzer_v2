# News Bias Analyzer - Diagrams and Technical Visualization

This directory contains visual diagrams that explain the architecture, data flows, and implementation details of the News Bias Analyzer system.

## Simplified Architecture (Current)

[Simplified Architecture Diagrams](simplified_architecture.md) provides visualizations of the current simplified system architecture after consolidation, including:

- Simplified System Overview - The streamlined system architecture with consolidated components
- Simplified Data Flow - The flow of data through the consolidated system
- Simplified Analysis Pipeline - Sequence diagram of the OpenAI-only analysis workflow
- Component Structure - Dependency graph of the simplified module structure
- Simplified Operation Flow - Flow diagram of the unified runner script operations
- Browser Extension Flow - Updated sequence diagram for browser extension functionality

This represents the current architecture after removing redundancy and consolidating components.

## Legacy Architecture Documentation

The following files document the previous system architecture before simplification:

- [System Architecture Diagrams](system_architecture.md) - Original detailed system diagrams
- [Data Flow Diagrams](data_flow_diagrams.md) - Original detailed data flow diagrams
- [Implementation Diagrams](implementation_diagrams.md) - Technical implementation details

These diagrams use Mermaid syntax which can be viewed:

1. Directly on GitHub which supports Mermaid rendering
2. By pasting the Mermaid code into a Mermaid Live Editor (https://mermaid.live/)
3. Using VS Code with a Mermaid extension
4. By rendering to images using the Mermaid CLI
