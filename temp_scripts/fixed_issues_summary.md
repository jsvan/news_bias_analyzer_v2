# News Bias Analyzer - Fixed Issues Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **SQLAlchemy Syntax Error**
   - Updated `text()` import: Added proper import from SQLAlchemy for raw SQL queries
   - Fixed in `scrape_to_db.py` line 443: `from sqlalchemy import text`
   - Applied `text()` function to raw SQL queries: `result = test_session.execute(text("SELECT 1")).fetchone()`

2. **URL Filtering** 
   - Added filtering to skip URLs without proper article paths
   - Filters URLs with fewer than 3 '/' characters
   - Filters URLs ending with '/' (likely section/category pages)
   - Filters URLs containing patterns like `/tag/`, `/category/`, `/author/`, etc.
   - Improved URL validation to focus scraping on actual article content

3. **Signal Handler Enhancement**
   - Added signal handler to catch keyboard interrupts (Ctrl+C)
   - Ensures any pending database transactions are committed
   - Properly closes database connections on exit
   - Prevents data loss when the scraper is interrupted

4. **Batch Size Adjustment**
   - Reduced batch size in the analyzer from 100 to 50 articles
   - Helps reduce memory usage and improve stability

5. **Database Transaction Management**
   - Added explicit transaction management with proper error handling
   - Added verification steps to confirm article insertion
   - Improved error reporting and logging
   - Added validation of article data before insertion

6. **Database Connection Verification**
   - Added explicit verification of database connection on startup
   - Added checks for table existence and structure
   - Ensures proper error reporting for connection issues

## Diagnostic Tests Created

1. **Database Insertion Test**
   - Created `debug_db_insert.py` to verify database functionality
   - Successfully inserts test articles into the database
   - Verifies increase in article count

2. **URL Filtering Test**
   - Created `debug_url_filtering.py` to test URL filtering
   - Confirms that the URL filtering logic correctly identifies article URLs
   - Filters out non-article URLs based on various criteria

3. **Article Extraction Method Test**
   - Tested different article extraction methods (wget vs requests)
   - Confirmed that wget+trafilatura generally performs best for content extraction

## Current Status

- All fixes have been implemented and tested
- Database connection and table structure verification is working
- Article insertion is working (verified with test script)
- URL filtering is working correctly (verified with test script)
- Scraper can now safely handle interruptions (Ctrl+C)
- Scraper periodically commits changes to prevent data loss

## Remaining Tasks

1. **Optimize Scraper Performance**
   - Consider adjusting batch sizes for better performance
   - Monitor memory usage during scraping to identify potential issues

2. **Improve Error Handling**
   - Continue monitoring for and addressing any hidden exceptions
   - Add more comprehensive error reporting for feed parsing and article extraction

3. **Monitoring & Logging**
   - Set up monitoring to track article insertion rates
   - Improve log aggregation to identify patterns in failed articles

4. **Automated Testing**
   - Consider implementing regular automated tests to verify system functionality
   - Create more comprehensive test suites for different aspects of the system
