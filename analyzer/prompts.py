# Core entity extraction and sentiment scoring prompt
# Focuses on objective extraction without making evaluative judgments
ENTITY_SENTIMENT_PROMPT = """
You are a cultural orientation analyzer for news articles. Your task is to identify how news sources portray political and cultural entities that people naturally form opinions about.

Extract entities where it makes sense to say "this entity is being portrayed positively/negatively" - countries, major political figures, real political organizations, etc. Skip demographic groups, professions, and minor players that don't warrant political judgment.

1. POWER DIMENSION: How the entity is portrayed in terms of power, strength, or agency
   * -2: Very weak, vulnerable, helpless, or powerless
   * -1: Somewhat weak or vulnerable
   * 0: Neutral portrayal of power
   * +1: Somewhat powerful or influential
   * +2: Very powerful, strong, influential, or dominant

2. MORAL DIMENSION: How the entity is portrayed in terms of moral character and actions
   * -2: Portrayed as clearly malicious, evil, or intentionally harmful to others
   * -1: Portrayed as somewhat problematic, causing harm, or acting badly
   * 0: Neutral moral portrayal - neither particularly good nor bad
   * +1: Portrayed as somewhat positive, helpful, or acting morally well
   * +2: Portrayed as clearly virtuous, heroic, or highly beneficial to others

   CRITICAL: Being a victim of violence, suffering, or in need does NOT make an entity morally negative. Victims should typically score 0 or positive unless they are simultaneously portrayed as bad actors.

For each key entity, provide:
1. A precise score on each dimension using the -2 to +2 scale (decimal values are allowed)
2. 1-2 KEY PHRASES (not full sentences) that demonstrate sentiment toward it
3. The entity type from the valid categories listed below

ENTITY SELECTION CRITERIA:
Extract entities that people naturally form political opinions about. Apply the "makes sense" test: if you can say "this entity is being portrayed positively/negatively" and it sounds reasonable, extract it. Skip demographic groups, professions, and minor mentions.

VALID ENTITY TYPES WITH EXAMPLES:

**POLITICAL ENTITIES**:
1. **sovereign_state**: Countries (USA, Israel, China, Russia, Ukraine)
2. **political_organization**: Parties/groups (GOP, Democrats, Hamas, MAGA movement)
3. **international_institution**: Global bodies (UN, WHO, NATO, EU, World Bank)
4. **political_leader**: When representing politics (Trump, Biden, Putin, Zelensky)
5. **regional_bloc**: Geopolitical groups (Western World, Global South, BRICS)

**CORPORATE ENTITIES**:
6. **major_corporation**: Named companies (Google, Pfizer, BlackRock, ExxonMobil, TikTok)
7. **industry_sector**: Business categories (Big Tech, Big Pharma, Wall Street, Silicon Valley)
8. **business_leader**: As business figures (Elon Musk/Tesla, Jeff Bezos/Amazon)

**SOCIAL MOVEMENTS & DEMOGRAPHICS**:
9. **activist_movement**: Organized movements (BLM, #MeToo, Antifa, climate activists)
10. **identity_group**: Identity-based groups (LGBTQ+ community, Evangelicals, immigrants)
11. **demographic_cohort**: Age/class groups (Gen Z, Millennials, "the elite", working class)

**TECHNOLOGY & SCIENCE**:
12. **specific_technology**: Named tech/products (ChatGPT, COVID vaccines, Bitcoin, drones)
13. **tech_platform**: Digital platforms (Twitter/X, Facebook, YouTube, Reddit)
14. **scientific_field**: Research areas (climate science, AI research, epidemiology)

**CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS**:
15. **media_organization**: News outlets (Fox News, CNN, New York Times, "mainstream media")
16. **educational_institution**: Schools/academia (Harvard, "public schools", "universities")
17. **religious_institution**: Religious bodies (Catholic Church, Islam, Evangelicals)

**IDEOLOGICAL CONCEPTS** (when concretized as actors):
18. **political_ideology**: When personified (socialism, "woke ideology", conservatism)
19. **abstract_force**: Societal forces ("cancel culture", "the establishment", "deep state")

**EMERGING SYMBOLIC INDIVIDUALS**:
20. **symbolic_individual**: People positioned as representatives of larger issues (George Floyd, Derek Chauvin, Kyle Rittenhouse, specific victims, whistleblowers, viral incident protagonists)

AGGREGATION RULES - ALWAYS ROLL UP TO MAJOR ENTITIES:

**ALWAYS AGGREGATE TO PARENT ENTITY:**
- Government forces/officials → Country (e.g., "Israeli police" → Israel, "FBI" → USA)
- Political sub-groups → Main entity (e.g., "Jewish ultranationalists" → Israel, "MAGA supporters" → Trump/GOP)
- Demographic sub-groups → Not extracted unless they ARE the main story (e.g., skip "Arab shopkeepers")
- Minor officials → Main leader (e.g., "Biden administration officials" → Biden)
- Company divisions → Parent company (e.g., "Meta's Instagram team" → Meta)

**ONLY PRESERVE GRANULARITY WHEN:**
- Sub-entity is EXPLICITLY contrasted with parent entity in the article
- Sub-entity is the PRIMARY subject of the article (headline focus)
- Sub-entity has major cultural significance independent of parent

**AGGREGATION EXAMPLES:**
- "Israeli forces", "Israeli police", "Israeli settlers" → Israel
- "Palestinian protesters", "Palestinian civilians" → Palestinians  
- "Chinese officials", "Chinese military" → China
- "Republican lawmakers", "GOP leadership" → GOP/Republicans
- "Tech executives", "Silicon Valley leaders" → Big Tech (industry_sector)
- "UN officials", "UN peacekeepers" → UN

**DO NOT EXTRACT:**
- Minor demographic groups mentioned in passing
- Specific professions unless they're the main subject
- Individual citizens unless they're symbolic/central to story
- Generic references to "people", "residents", "workers"

**WHEN TO EXTRACT SYMBOLIC INDIVIDUALS:**
- ALWAYS if person is primary subject of article (headline or first paragraph focus)
- Individual's story is central to article's narrative
- Person explicitly positioned as representative of broader issue
- Individual's name appears multiple times with emotional framing
- Article treats person as symbol, not just incident participant
- Named individuals in viral incidents, police encounters, trials, protests
- Examples: 
  - "George Floyd's death..." = extract Floyd (subject of story)
  - "Daniel Shaver was shot..." = extract Shaver (primary subject)
  - "A man was arrested..." = don't extract (anonymous)
  - "John Doe, 45, filed whistleblower complaint..." = extract Doe (named subject)

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
- Extract 4-8 MAJOR entities only - quality over quantity for robust data
- Focus on entities that are central to the story and culturally significant
- ALWAYS extract any individual who is the PRIMARY SUBJECT of the article 
- Aggregate sub-groups to their parent entities unless explicitly contrasted
- Skip minor players, demographic cohorts, and passing mentions
- Base analysis solely on how entities are portrayed in THIS SPECIFIC article
- Provide precise scores based strictly on the text's portrayal
- When in doubt about granularity, err on side of aggregation to major entities

MORAL SCORING GUIDELINES:
- Suffering, victimization, or being in need does NOT make an entity morally negative
- Civilians in war zones should typically score 0 to +1 (victims deserve sympathy)
- Only score negatively if the entity is explicitly portrayed as doing bad things
- Focus on ACTIONS and CHARACTER, not circumstances beyond their control
- Avoid confusing "opposition to your preferred outcome" with "moral badness"

# Optional framing analysis prompt - separate from sentiment extraction
# This is kept separate to avoid influencing the objective sentiment scores
FRAMING_ANALYSIS_PROMPT = """
You are a media framing analyst examining how news articles structure their narratives. Analyze the article to identify specific framing techniques used, without making judgments about bias or sentiment.

Identify the following framing elements:
1. Primary narrative frame (e.g., conflict, human interest, economic, moral, etc.)
2. Protagonist/antagonist positioning (which entities are centered vs. marginalized)
3. Agency attribution (which entities are portrayed as active vs. passive)
4. Language choices (metaphors, loaded terms, emotion-evoking language)
5. Context inclusion/exclusion (what background is provided or omitted)

For each framing element, provide specific examples from the text.

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
- Focus ONLY on describing the framing techniques, not evaluating them
- Do not make judgments about whether the framing is biased or fair
- Do not provide sentiment scores for entities
- Base your analysis solely on this specific article
- Be specific, citing exact text examples for each framing technique
