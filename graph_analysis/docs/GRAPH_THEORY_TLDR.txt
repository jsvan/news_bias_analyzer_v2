GRAPH THEORY TLDR: Entity Correlation Networks in News Bias Analysis

THE PROBLEM (Graph Theory Perspective)

We're analyzing DYNAMIC SIGNED GRAPHS where:
- NODES = political entities (politicians, countries, organizations)
- EDGES = sentiment correlation between entities when they co-occur in news articles
- EDGE WEIGHTS = correlation coefficient (-1 to +1) 
- MULTIPLE GRAPH INSTANCES = one per news source
- TEMPORAL EVOLUTION = edge weights change over time

CORE QUESTION: Can we characterize the SPECTRAL PROPERTIES and STRUCTURAL EVOLUTION of these correlation networks to detect ideological bias and predict narrative shifts?

MATHEMATICAL FRAMEWORK

Graph Construction:
G_s(t) = (V, E, w) where:
- V = entity set (shared across all sources)
- E = edges between co-occurring entities  
- w: E → [-1,1] = sentiment correlation weights for source s at time t

Key Graph Properties We're Analyzing:
1. SPECTRAL CLUSTERING of correlation matrices to identify ideological communities
2. GRAPH DISTANCE METRICS between sources (Frobenius norm of correlation matrices)
3. TEMPORAL GRAPH EVOLUTION - how does graph structure change over time?
4. CENTRALITY MEASURES for entity influence ranking
5. GRAPH LAPLACIAN EIGENVALUES for polarization quantification

INTERESTING GRAPH THEORY PROBLEMS

1. Multi-layer Network Analysis
- Each news source = separate layer in multiplex network
- CHALLENGE: How do we measure "distance" between ideological graph layers?
- OPEN QUESTION: What spectral properties distinguish ideological differences?

2. Dynamic Community Detection
- Entities cluster differently across sources (Trump+Military+Economy vs Trump+Controversy+Scandal)
- CHALLENGE: Detect when entity communities shift across sources over time
- GRAPH THEORY HOOK: This is essentially TEMPORAL COMMUNITY DETECTION ON SIGNED MULTIPLEX NETWORKS

3. Graph Signal Processing on Ideological Networks
- Treat sentiment as signals on entity graphs
- CHALLENGE: How does sentiment "diffuse" through correlation networks?
- OPEN QUESTION: Can we characterize the SPECTRAL PROPERTIES OF SENTIMENT PROPAGATION?

4. Algebraic Connectivity and Polarization
- Hypothesis: FIEDLER EIGENVALUE correlates with ideological polarization
- Lower algebraic connectivity = more polarized entity relationships
- GRAPH THEORY CHALLENGE: Prove relationship between spectral properties and polarization measures

SPECIFIC TECHNICAL CHALLENGES

1. Correlation Matrix Spectral Analysis
# For each news source, we have correlation matrix C_s
# where C_s[i,j] = correlation(entity_i_sentiment, entity_j_sentiment)

Questions:
- What do the eigenvalue distributions tell us about ideological structure?
- Can we use matrix factorization to find latent ideological dimensions?
- How stable are principal eigenvectors across time windows?

2. Graph Distance Metrics for Ideology
# We need distance d(G_s1, G_s2) between source graphs
# Current ideas:
- Frobenius norm: ||C_s1 - C_s2||_F
- Spectral distance: ||λ(C_s1) - λ(C_s2)||
- Graph edit distance on correlation networks

Question: Which distance metric best captures ideological similarity?

3. Temporal Graph Changepoint Detection
# Given time series of graphs G_s(t1), G_s(t2), ..., G_s(tn)
# Detect when graph structure changes significantly

Graph theory challenge:
- How do we define "significant change" in weighted graph structure?
- Can we use spectral methods for changepoint detection?
- What's the optimal time window for stability vs sensitivity?

4. Signed Graph Clustering with Constraints
# Entities have types (politician, country, organization, concept)
# Some correlations should be impossible (e.g., countries can't directly correlate)

Challenge: Constrained spectral clustering on signed graphs
Question: How do entity type constraints affect clustering algorithms?

COOL APPLICATIONS OF GRAPH THEORY

1. Ideological Space Embedding
- Use GRAPH EMBEDDING METHODS (node2vec, GraphSAGE) to place entities in ideological space
- Each news source creates different embeddings for same entities
- MEASURE IDEOLOGICAL BIAS as embedding distance between sources

2. Influence Propagation Modeling
- Model sentiment spread using RANDOM WALKS on correlation graphs
- CENTRALITY MEASURES identify entities that amplify sentiment changes
- GRAPH NEURAL NETWORKS for predicting sentiment cascades

3. Polarization as Graph Property
- ALGEBRAIC CONNECTIVITY as polarization measure
- MODULARITY OPTIMIZATION to find ideological communities
- SPECTRAL BISECTION for identifying polarizing entities

4. Early Warning via Spectral Analysis
- Track LEADING EIGENVALUES of correlation matrices over time
- SPECTRAL CHANGEPOINT DETECTION for editorial shift prediction
- GRAPH STABILITY METRICS for narrative consistency measurement

THE BIG GRAPH THEORY QUESTION

Can we develop a complete spectral characterization of ideological bias in correlation networks?

Specifically:
- Do ideological differences have SPECTRAL SIGNATURES?
- Can we predict graph evolution using SPECTRAL DYNAMICS?
- Is there a UNIVERSAL STRUCTURE to political correlation networks?

This could be the foundation for a new field: COMPUTATIONAL POLITICAL GRAPH THEORY.
