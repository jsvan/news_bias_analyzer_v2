# Graph Theory TLDR: Entity Correlation Networks in News Bias Analysis

## The Problem (Graph Theory Perspective)

We're analyzing **dynamic signed graphs** where:
- **Nodes** = political entities (politicians, countries, organizations)
- **Edges** = sentiment correlation between entities when they co-occur in news articles
- **Edge weights** = correlation coefficient (-1 to +1) 
- **Multiple graph instances** = one per news source
- **Temporal evolution** = edge weights change over time

**Core Question**: Can we characterize the **spectral properties** and **structural evolution** of these correlation networks to detect ideological bias and predict narrative shifts?

## Mathematical Framework

### Graph Construction
```
G_s(t) = (V, E, w) where:
- V = entity set (shared across all sources)
- E = edges between co-occurring entities  
- w: E â†’ [-1,1] = sentiment correlation weights for source s at time t
```

### Key Graph Properties We're Analyzing
1. **Spectral clustering** of correlation matrices to identify ideological communities
2. **Graph distance metrics** between sources (Frobenius norm of correlation matrices)
3. **Temporal graph evolution** - how does graph structure change over time?
4. **Centrality measures** for entity influence ranking
5. **Graph Laplacian eigenvalues** for polarization quantification

## Interesting Graph Theory Problems

### 1. **Multi-layer Network Analysis**
- Each news source = separate layer in multiplex network
- **Challenge**: How do we measure "distance" between ideological graph layers?
- **Open Question**: What spectral properties distinguish ideological differences?

### 2. **Dynamic Community Detection**
- Entities cluster differently across sources (Trump+Military+Economy vs Trump+Controversy+Scandal)
- **Challenge**: Detect when entity communities shift across sources over time
- **Graph Theory Hook**: This is essentially **temporal community detection on signed multiplex networks**

### 3. **Graph Signal Processing on Ideological Networks**
- Treat sentiment as signals on entity graphs
- **Challenge**: How does sentiment "diffuse" through correlation networks?
- **Open Question**: Can we characterize the **spectral properties of sentiment propagation**?

### 4. **Algebraic Connectivity and Polarization**
- Hypothesis: **Fiedler eigenvalue** correlates with ideological polarization
- Lower algebraic connectivity = more polarized entity relationships
- **Graph Theory Challenge**: Prove relationship between spectral properties and polarization measures

## Specific Technical Challenges

### 1. **Correlation Matrix Spectral Analysis**
```python
# For each news source, we have correlation matrix C_s
# where C_s[i,j] = correlation(entity_i_sentiment, entity_j_sentiment)

# Questions:
- What do the eigenvalue distributions tell us about ideological structure?
- Can we use matrix factorization to find latent ideological dimensions?
- How stable are principal eigenvectors across time windows?
```

### 2. **Graph Distance Metrics for Ideology**
```python
# We need distance d(G_s1, G_s2) between source graphs
# Current ideas:
- Frobenius norm: ||C_s1 - C_s2||_F
- Spectral distance: ||Î»(C_s1) - Î»(C_s2)||
- Graph edit distance on correlation networks

# Question: Which distance metric best captures ideological similarity?
```

### 3. **Temporal Graph Changepoint Detection**
```python
# Given time series of graphs G_s(t1), G_s(t2), ..., G_s(tn)
# Detect when graph structure changes significantly

# Graph theory challenge:
- How do we define "significant change" in weighted graph structure?
- Can we use spectral methods for changepoint detection?
- What's the optimal time window for stability vs sensitivity?
```

### 4. **Signed Graph Clustering with Constraints**
```python
# Entities have types (politician, country, organization, concept)
# Some correlations should be impossible (e.g., countries can't directly correlate)

# Challenge: Constrained spectral clustering on signed graphs
# Question: How do entity type constraints affect clustering algorithms?
```

## Cool Applications of Graph Theory

### 1. **Ideological Space Embedding**
- Use **graph embedding methods** (node2vec, GraphSAGE) to place entities in ideological space
- Each news source creates different embeddings for same entities
- **Measure ideological bias** as embedding distance between sources

### 2. **Influence Propagation Modeling**
- Model sentiment spread using **random walks** on correlation graphs
- **Centrality measures** identify entities that amplify sentiment changes
- **Graph neural networks** for predicting sentiment cascades

### 3. **Polarization as Graph Property**
- **Algebraic connectivity** as polarization measure
- **Modularity optimization** to find ideological communities
- **Spectral bisection** for identifying polarizing entities

### 4. **Early Warning via Spectral Analysis**
- Track **leading eigenvalues** of correlation matrices over time
- **Spectral changepoint detection** for editorial shift prediction
- **Graph stability metrics** for narrative consistency measurement
